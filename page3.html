        <p>Our store is located in the historic Gatbsy Residence in West Egg, New York. 
            The building was constructed in the early 1920s and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. 
            No one has lived in the residence since the death of Mr. Gatsby. Following his death, Nick Carraway and the Gatsby estate converted the building and grounds to a public park. 
            We do offer tours of the residence. Please <a href="page2.html">call</a> to schedule an appointment. COVID-19 mask and social distancing guidelines apply.</p>
